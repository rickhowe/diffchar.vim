INTRODUCTION                                           *diffchar*

This plugin has been developed in order to make diff mode more useful. Vim
highlights all the text in between the first and last different characters on
a changed line. But this plugin will find the exact differences between them,
character by character - so called DiffChar.

For example, in diff mode: ( [DiffText], <DiffAdd> )
>
    (window A) The [quick brown fox jumps over the lazy] dog.
    (window B) The [lazy fox jumps over the quick brown] dog.
<
this plugin will exactly show the changed and added units:
>
    (window A) The [quick] <brown >fox jumps over the [lazy] dog.
    (window B) The [lazy] fox jumps over the [quick] <brown >dog.
<
This plugin will synchronously show/reset the highlights of the exact
differences as soon as the diff mode starts/ends since a |g:DiffModeSync| is
enabled as a default. It synchronously works as well on your custom diff tool
(e.g. git-diff) when you have specified it to the 'diffexpr' option.

In non-diff mode or when the |g:DiffModeSync| is disabled, you can toggle to
show/reset the diff highlights by pressing <F7> or <F8> or using |:TDChar|
command. To show or reset them, use |:SDChar| or |:RDChar| command.

In diff mode, the corresponding changed lines are compared between two
windows. In non-diff mode, the same lines are compared among them. You can
set a matching color to a |g:DiffColors| to make it easy to recognize the
corresponding changed units between two windows. As a default, all the 
changed units are highlighted with DiffText. In addition, DiffAdd is always
used for the added units and both the previous and next character of the
deleted units are underlined.

This plugin traces the differences based on a |g:DiffUnit|. Its default is
'Word1' and it handles a \w\+ word and a \W character as a difference unit.
There are other types of word provided and you can also set 'Char' to compare
character by character.

While showing the exact differences, you can use ]b or ]e to jump cursor to
the start or end position of the next difference unit, and [b or [e to the
start or end position of the previous unit. Then this plugin echoes the
corresponding difference unit with the assigned color as a message. Those
keymaps, <F7> and <F8> are configurable in your vimrc and so on.

This plugin always keeps the exact differences updated while editing if a
|g:DiffUpdate| is enabled and TextChanged/TextChangedI events are available.

This plugin has been using "An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm" developed
by S.Wu, et al., which always finds an optimum sequence quickly. But for
longer lines and less-similar files, it takes time to complete the diff
tracing. To make it more efficient, this plugin splits the tracing with the
external diff command. Firstly applies the internal O(NP) algorithm. If not
completed within the time specified by a |g:DiffSplitTime|, continuously
switches to the diff command at that point, and then joins both results. This
approach provides a stable performance and reasonable accuracy, because the
diff command effectively optimizes between them. Its default is 100 ms, which
would be useful for smaller files. If prefer to always apply the internal
algorithm for accuracy (or the diff command for performance), set some large
value (or 0) to it.

This plugin sets the DiffCharExpr() to the 'diffexpr' option, if it is empty.
It also uses the |g:DiffSplitTime| and splits the tracing between the
internal algorithm and the external diff command. If prefer to leave the
'diffexpr' option as empty, set 0 to a |g:DiffExpr|.

This plugin works on each tab page individually. You can use a tab page
variable (t:), instead of a global one (g:), to specify different options on
each tab page.

This plugin has been always positively supporting mulltibyte characters.

CHANGE HISTORY                                         *diffchar-history*

Update : 6.2
* Enhanced to always keep the exact differences updated while editing if
  g:DiffUpdate is enabled, even if a total number of lines are changed (some
  lines are added or deleted).
* Changed to handle all the windows as non-diff mode if more than 2 diff mode
  buffers exist in a tabpage.
* Fixed not to cause an error if the number of lines are different between two
  windows on %SDChar in non-diff mode.

Update : 6.1
* Improved a workaround for vim 7.4.682 (at update 5.1) not to disappear vim's
  DiffChange/DiffText highlights in other tab pages.
* Improved to handle diff tracing only once in one diff session when more than
  2 buffers become diff mode and DiffModeSync is enabled.
* Fixed to correctly reset diffchar highlights on a split window when the
  window is closed.

Update : 6.0
* Defined a new :TDChar command to toggle the highlights for specified range,
  and make it possible to select a block of lines in visual mode and toggle
  them by using <F8>.
* Changed the default value of g:DiffUnit from 'Char' to 'Word1', where \w\+
  is handled as a single difference unit, to make more sense to usual case.
* Changed the default value of g:DiffSplitTime from 500 to 100 to switch more
  quickly and changed to check the time more often (unit-by-unit, not
  line-by-line) to detect the time limit earlier.
* Changed to use the g:DiffSplitTime, instead of the number of lines as an
  argument, in the DiffCharExpr() to switch to the diff command as accurately
  as specified.
* Improved the way to analyze the output of the diff command quickly.
* Enhanced to interactively update the highlights faster while editing when
  g:DiffUpdate is enabled.
* Changed the position of a pair cursor for a deleted unit on either its
  previous or next character instead of both.
* Fixed to ignore white spaces at line end when iwhite is specified in the
  'diffopt' option.
* Fixed to enable to use a t:DiffModeSync tab page variable as well as its
  global one.

Update : 5.5
* Introduced g:DiffModeSync to synchronously show/reset the highlights as the
  diff mode starts/ends, which also works on your custom diff tool.
* Changed to enable g:DiffUpdate as a default and then interactively update
  the highlights while editing.
* Enhanced to draw and delete the highlights faster by specifying as many
  position parameters as possible in one matchaddpos() and matchadd() call.
* Changed to select current window and next diff mode window (if present)
  whose buffer is different at initialize.
* Fixed:
  - caused an error on getwinvar() in vim 7.3.
  - in non-gVim, did not show a matching pair cursor when jumping the cursor
    by using [e or ]b, depending on a color scheme.
  - sometimes failed to toggle the highlights when using <F7> or <F8> in diff
    mode windows.
  - did not interactively update the highlight of all the lines when multiple
    lines were changed at once if g:DiffUpdate = 1.

Update : 5.4
* Enhanced to show a position of a deleted unit with underline on its
  previous and next characters. This position is where a unit is added
  between those characters in another diffchar window.
* Improved to be able to change this plugin's global variables anytime.
* Changed to select current window and then the next (wincmd w) window whose
  buffer is different.

Update : 5.3
* Performance improved for long lines and some defects fixed when the diff
  command is used for the diff tracing.

Update : 5.2
* Enhanced to provide a stable performance even for less-similar long files.
  The new approach applies this plugin's algorithm first, and if not
  completed within the specified time, continuously splits the tracing with
  the diff command, and join both results.
* Fixed: when diff command does not choose minimal algorithm and it shows the
  equivalent lines as "changed", this plugin sometimes makes an error.
* Fixed: if file encoding is not same as buffer encoding, a difference may
  not be correctly detected in DiffCharExpr().

Update : 5.1
* Since vim 7.4.682, it has become impossible to overwrite the vim's diff
  highlights with this plugin. Then, for example, DiffText bold typeface will
  be left in all the diff highlighted lines (for more info, see
  https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en_US#!topic/vim_use/1jQnbTva2fY). This
  update provides a workaround to reduce its effect and to show the
  differences mostly same as before.

Update : 5.0
* Significantly improved the way to trace and show the differences and make
  them 1.5 ~ 2.0 times faster.
* Introduced g:DiffMaxRatio (and t:DiffMaxRatio), a maximum difference ratio
  to trace (100% as default). Once exceeds, the diff tracing is recursively
  split and helps to keep performance instead of diff accuracy.
* Discontinued other difference algorithms (OND and Basic) than the ONP, then
  g:DiffAlgorithm no longer supported.
* Improved to allow to specify one or more characters for 'CSV(c)' in
  g:DiffUnit (and t:DiffUnit). For example, 'CSV(,:\t)' will split the units
  by a comma, colon, and tab. Use '\\' for a backslash.

Update : 4.9
* Fixed DiffCharExpr() to check the number of total lines, not different
  lines only, of both windows and apply either internal algorithm or external
  diff command, in order to keep the appropriate performance for large files.

Update : 4.81
* Enhanced to make DiffCharExpr() a bit faster by using uniq() or so.

Update : 4.8
* Enhanced to set the threshold value on DiffCharExpr() to check how many
  differences and then apply either of internal algorithm or external diff
  command. The default for 'diffexpr' option using DiffCharExpr() is changed to
  use this threshold, 200 - apply internal if less than 200 differences,
  apply external if more.
* Changed the way to select windows when more than 2 windows in the page.
  - automatically select the diff mode's next (wincmd w) window, if any, in
    addition to the current window
  - can select any of split windows as vim can do for diff

Update : 4.7
* Enhanced to set DiffCharExpr() to the 'diffexpr' option, if it is empty. When
  diff mode begins, vim calls this function which finds differences by this
  plugin's internal diff algorithm (default) and then initially shows the
  exact differences (default). You can also explicitly set this function to
  the option with different arguments.
* Enhanced to make the key mappings configurable.
  For example, the default <F7> can be modified by:
       nmap <silent> your_favorite_key <Plug>ToggleDiffCharAllLines
* Fixed to correctly adjust the position of difference units when 'diffopt'
  iwhite option is enabled.

Update : 4.6
* Fixed to correctly show the colors of changed units in one-by-one defined
  order of g:DiffColors. Since an added unit was improperly counted as
  changed one, some colors were skipped and not shown. The first changed unit
  is now always highlighted with DiffText in any color mode.

Update : 4.5
* Fixed to trace the differences until the end of the units. Previously the
  last same units were skipped, so last added units were sometimes shown as
  changed ones (eg: the last "swift brown" on above were shown as changed
  units but now shows "brown" as added ones).
* Enhanced to use your global variables if defined in vimrc.

Update : 4.4
* Enhanced to follow 'diffopt' icase and iwhite options for both diff and
  non-diff modes (ignorecase option is not used). Previously, it has been
  always case and space/tab sensitive.
* Implemented to highlight the difference units using a new matchaddpos()
  function, introduced in 7.4.330, when available to draw faster.

Update : 4.3
* Enhanced to differently show added/deleted/changed difference units with
  original diff highlightings.
  - added units will be always highlighted with DiffAdd.
  - changed units will be highlighted based on the g:DiffColors (and
    t:DiffColors) variable, but DiffText is always used for the first changed
    unit.
  - when jumping cursor by [b/]b or [e/]e on the added unit, it highlights
    around the corresponding deleted units with a cursor-type color in
    another window, and echoes a diff-delete filler with DiffDelete, along
    with common characters on both sides (e.g. a-----b).

Update : 4.2
* Enhanced to update the highlighted DiffChar units while editing. A
  g:DiffUpdate (and t:DiffUpdate) variable enables and disables (default)
  this update behavior. If a text line was added/deleted, reset all the
  highlightings. This feature is available on vim 7.4.

Update : 4.1
* Implemented to echo a matching difference unit with its color when jumping
  cursor by [b/]b or [e/]e.
* Fixed defects: not using the new uniq() function introduced in vim 7.4.

Update : 4.0
* Enhanced to easily find a corresponding pair of each difference unit.
  - each unit pair will be shown in individual same color on both windows. A
    g:DiffColors (and t:DiffColors) variable is a type of matching colors, 0
    (default) for always 1 color as before, 1/2/3 for 4/8/16 colors in fixed
    order, and 100 for all available colors in dynamic random order.
  - when jumping cursor by [b/]b or [e/]e in either window, the start or end
    position of a matching unit will be highlighted with a cursor-type color
    in another window.

Update : 3.6
* Added two g:DiffUnit (and t:DiffUnit) types. 'Word3' will split at the \<
  or \> boundaries, which can separate based on the character class like CJK,
  Hiragana, Katakana, Hangul, full width symbols and so on. And 'CSV(c)' will
  split the units by a specified character 'c'. For example, 'CSV(,)' and
  'CSV(\t)' can be used for comma and tab separated text.

Update : 3.5
* Fixed defects: DiffChar highlighting units do not override/hide hlsearch.

Update : 3.4
* Enhanced to support individual DiffChar handling on each tab page.
  Difference unit and algorithm can also be set page by page using tab page
  local variables, t:DiffUnit and t:DiffAlgorithm.

Update : 3.3
* Enhanced to jump cursor to the DiffChar highlighting units. Sample keymaps
  ]b and [b will move cursor forwards to the next and backwards to the
  previous start positions. And ]e and [e will move to the end positions.

Update : 3.2
* Enhanced to follow diff mode without any limitations. Compare between the
  corresponding DiffChange lines on both windows and properly handle DiffAdd
  and DiffDelete lines.

Update : 3.1
* Enhanced to show/reset/toggle DiffChar highlightings on individual line by
  line.
* Implemented the window layout handling.
  - the DiffChar'ed windows will remain the highlightings even if the window
    position is rotated/replaced/moved and another new window opens.
  - if either DiffChar'ed window is closed, reset all the DiffChar
    highlightings on another window.
* Removed limitations:
  - when more than 2 windows exist, current and next (wincmd w) windows will
    be selected.
  - if the specified numbers of lines are different in both windows, ignore
    the redundant lines and continue to compare the text on the same lines.
  - RDChar sample command has a range attribute (e.g. %RDChar).
* Fixed defects:
  - reset just DiffChar highlightings only and remain others.

Update : 3.0
* Implemented word by word differences. A g:DiffUnit variable is a type of a
  difference unit. Its default is 'Char', which will trace character by
  character as before. 'Word1' will split into \w\+ words and any \W single
  characters. And 'Word2' will separate the units at the \s\+ space
  boundaries.
* Improved the performance around 10%.

Update : 2.1
* Coding changes in the O(NP) function for readability.

Update : 2.0
* Implemented the O(NP) and O(ND) Difference algorithms to improve the
  performance. This update uses the O(NP) by default, and can be changed to
  the O(ND) if necessary, or to the basic algorithm implemented in the
  initial version.
